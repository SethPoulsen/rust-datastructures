# rust-datastructures
Simple implementations of basic data structures and algorithms in Rust.

Right now, this is a fun project for me to practice some more rust. I'm
hoping that sometime in the future these data structures could serve as
a reference implementation and unit tests for introducing data structures
to students using Rust.
